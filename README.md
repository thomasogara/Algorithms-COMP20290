# Thomas O'Gara's Algorithms Portfolio
Algorithms, eh?

## Getting Started
To begin, please `git clone` the repository onto your local machine.

### Prerequisutes
There are a number of prerequisutes if you aim to run this project on your local machine. The first of those would be a Java Development Kit (JDK) for Java version 8+. The official Oracle JDK can be found at [oracle.com](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk8-downloads.html).  

		Please ensure that the JDK installed on your system is added to the PATH environment variable.
   
$PATH = /usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.8.0_241/bin:$PATH
