I don't belong in the world, that's what it is
Something separates me from other people
Everywhere I turn
There's something blocking my escapeIt took thirteen beaches to find one empty
But finally, it's mine
With drippin' peaches, I'm camera ready
Almost all the timeBut I still get lonely
And baby, only then do I let myself recline
Can I let go, and let your memory dance
In the ballroom of my mind
Across the county lineIt hurts to love you, but I still love you
It's just the way I feel
And I'd be lyin', if I kept hidin'
The fact that I can't deal
And that I've been dyin'
For somethin' real
That I've been dyin'
For somethin' realIt took thirteen beaches to find one empty
But finally, I'm fine
Past Ventura and lenses plenty
In the white sunshineBut you still can find me, if you ask nicely
Underneath the pines
With the daisies, feelin' hazy
In the ballroom of my mind
Across the county lineIt hurts to love you, but I still love you
It's just the way I feel
And I'd be lyin', if I kept hidin'
The fact that I can't deal
And that I've been dyin'
For somethin' real
That I've been dyin'
For somethin' realIt hurts to love you, but I still love you
It's just the way I feel
And I'd be lying', if I kept hidin'
The fact that I can't deal
The fact that I can't dealCarry me up them stairs
Put my white socks on
And my pretty song
You like my blue nail polish
"What is all this?"
You said
"The miss upstairs
Don't be scared"
Daddy dearest
You know how I like to take trips
Pops for stops at the K-mart
Buy me my peach lipgloss
Cigarettes and lolipops
For I trip across the USA
We're gonna party like it's 1949
We're in the Pontiac from July to July
Gonna see it all before we he says goodbye
Gonna party like it's 1949
Carry me up the stairs
With my white socks on
And my blonde hair long
You like my pinup buttons
And the solist
That comes with the midnight air
And my icy stare
It's the clearest
When it's me and him alone
He stops, he talks
Better the ways he used to metal
Dinerettes and soda pops
For I trip across the USA
We're gonna party like it's 1949
We're in the Pontiac from July to July
Gonna see it all before he says goodbye
Gonna party like it's 1949
Daylights, black, blue
Pleasure beaty roadstops
Me, I like the suicide souvenire giftshops
Late night, midnight
Radio show talks
Him and me a big gergage
Ponytail, night pops
Dinerettes and sodapops
New blue bathing suite
Ruched tops and cadillacs
Blue lake, car to docks
Hop skotch
I talk
Alabama hard knocks
Motel dresslocksThere's only 24 hours in a day
And half as many ways for you to lie to me, my little love
There's only 24 hours in a day
And half of those, you lay awake
With thoughts of murder and carnageIf you lie down with dogs, then you'll get fleas
Be careful of the company you keepThere's only 24 hours
And that's not enough
To lie like you lie or
Love like you loveThere's only 24 hours in a day
And half of those you lay
Between the sheets with me, my lying love
There's only 24 hours, so you'd say
For most of them you pay
For all the things they paid you for, my loveIf you lie down with dogs, then you'll get fleas
Be careful of the ones you choose to leaveThere's only 24 hours
And that's not enough
To lie like you lie or
Love like you loveGive me your heat
Give me your diamonds
You hit that street
And my crooked lust
You count to three
While they're all dying
You're hard to reach
You're cold to touchI'm America's sweetheart tryin' to get away
You make it hard to leave, but it's easier for me to stay,
Why I'm so afraid
And I've had it up to here with the fighting
Baby we're not fooling anyone these days
I don't wanna stay
But I'm so afraidBut it's not love that keeps me here
And it's not what you want to hearSo I'm going back to Santa Monica, New York to L.A.
Never coming back, boy, no matter what you do or say
'Cause I'm so afraid
And I've had it up to here with the panic and the fear
There's nothing in your heart
Thought that I could make you change,
But I'm so afraidBut it's not love that keeps me hereWe were just teenagers when we fell in love
Driving in your fast car, looking at the stars above
But it was not enough
You should never come between a woman and her dream
And a man who never knew his place
There's no easy way
To come back from where you cameBut it's not love that keeps me here
And it's not what you want to hearSo, baby, now I'm going back to Santa Monica, New York to L.A.
Never coming back, boy, no matter what you do or say
'Cause I'm so afraid
And I've had it up to here with the panic and the fear
Nothing in your heart
Boy, I thought that I could make you change,
But I'm so afraidBut it's not love, it's just the fear
You've put down for all these years
But I'm leaving nowI'm going back to Santa Monica, New York to L.A.
Never coming back, boy, no matter what you do or say
I am done being afraid
And I've had it up to here with the panic and the fear
There's nothing in your heart
I thought that I could make you change,
But I'm so afraidOh, it's not love that keeps me here
It's not love that keeps me here
I'm done being afraid
I am done being afraid

All the ladies of the canyon
Wearing black to the house parties
Crosby, Stills and Nash is playing
Wine is flowing with Bacardi
But sometimes girls just want to have fun
The poetry inside of me is warm like a gun[Chorus]
I bought me a truck in the middle of the night
It'll buy me a year if I play my cards right
Photo free exits from baby's bedside
'Cause they don't yet know what car I drive
I'm just tryna keep my love alive
With my bartender, hold me all night
Bartender, our love's alive
Baby remember, I'm not drinking wine
But that cherry coke you serve is fine
And our love's sweet enough on the vine
Bartender, bar-t-t-tender[Verse 2]
All the ladies of the canyon
Wearing white for their tea parties
Playing games of repetition
Meditating in the garden
And I love the little games that we play
From the valley to the beach
And when at last the day is done, I grab my keys[Chorus]
I bought me a truck in the middle of the night
It'll buy me a year if I play my cards right
Photo free exits from baby's bedside
'Cause they don't yet know what car I drive
I'm just tryna keep my love alive
With my bartender, hold me all night
Bartender, our love's alive
Baby remember, I'm not drinking wine
But that cherry coke you serve is fine
And our love's sweet enough on the vine
Bartender, bar-t-t-tender
Bar-t-t-tender, bar-t-t-tender
Ha, ha, ha, ha[Outro]
I bought me a truck in the middle of the night
60 MPH on PCH drive
Head to Long Beach to Newport
By your side as they don't yet know where I reside
60 miles from the last place I hide with my bar-t-t-tender
Hold me all night, bar-t-t-tender
Keep love alive, bar-t-t-tender[Intro]

What's up (x4)
Be my daddy (x3)
Be my, be my daddy tonightBlue is the color of the planet from the view above
Long live our reign, long live our love
Green is the planet from the eyes of a turtle dove
'Til it runs red, runs red with bloodWe get so tired and we complain
'Bout how it's hard to live
It's more than just a video gameBut we're just beautiful people
With beautiful problems, yeah
Beautiful problems, God knows we've got them
But we gotta try (lie-la-lie)
Every day and night (lie-la-lie)Blue is the collar of the shirt of the man I love
He's hard at work, hard to the touch
But warm is the body of the girl from the land he loves
My heart is soft, my past is roughBut when I love him, get a feeling
Something close to like a sugar rush
It runs through me, but is it wasted love?
(Let's not waste it, love)But we're just beautiful people
With beautiful problems, yeah
Beautiful problems, God knows we've got them
But we gotta try (lie-la-lie)
Every day and night (lie-la-lie)Yeah we've gotta try (lie-la-lie)
We gotta walk through fire, lie-la-lie
Because we're justBeautiful people with beautiful problems, yeah

You make me cuckoo like a turtle dove
So hot that I can't get enough
Enough of youHit me and it felt like a kiss
You know it hurts so good when you do me like this
So sad when I hear the girls talk
When I walk by, I start to cry(Sing it to me, babe)'Cause you're the beautiful player
You're a beautiful player, baby
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh ooh-ooh, baby
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh ah-ah-ah...(Sing it to me, doll)Sunset on a Saturday night
Having a truck top backrub time of our lives
He's selling stars on the boulevard of broken dreams
And faded queensWe're feeling like we wanna die fast

I love him violently all through the night
And yes it's true, I live for you(Sing it to me, babe)'Cause you're my beautiful player

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh ooh-ooh, baby
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh ooh-ooh-yeah...On the streets of LA
Where the future is now
We dance like nobody's watching us
And we live like we want to
But it can all get a little crazy
Unless there's something to hold onto
For me, that was true loveI was a young girl, selfish and wild
Like a fire in LA
Hot like the summer and mean like a child
Who keeps crying 'till she gets her way (like a true star)
There were roses in my hair, rock n roll on blare, and I was in trouble
And no one could rock me like you could
I was a bad girl gone goodLook at me now, I have everything
You gave to me and my heart can sing
I was a kid who could only drink
Dance on tables, makin' deal with devils like a drunk beauty queen
Fighting the fantasy, hooked on the scene, and it brought me to my knees
And it's all because of you (you know what I'm talkin' about)It was a mad world, we lived for fun
And we got shit for free
Had a face like an angel, but inside my heart was as black as a broke movie screen (it was pretty sad)
But then I saw you standing there, like a millionaire
Give me a number, call me before I get stupid
Make me uncrazy like you didLook at me now, I have everything
You gave to me and my heart can sing
I was a kid who could only drink
Dance on tables, makin' deal with devils like a drunk beauty queen
Fighting the fantasy, hooked on the scene, but you brought me to my knees
And it's all because of youIt isn't hard to see, you got a hold on me
Give me your money, love me to death
Talk like a baby, 'cause I'm so elated
You tell me that I ain't seen nothing quite yetI don't wanna lose it, I'm in love, but I didn't choose itRoses in my hair, dancing in the air, feels like I'm flying
Tell me you love me, boy, do it
It's just like I thought, I just knew itLook at me now, I have everything
You gave to me and my heart can sing
I was a kid who could only drink
Dance on tables, makin' deals with devils like a drunk beauty queen
Fighting the fantasy, hooked on the scene, you bring me to my knees
And it's all because of you
Yeah, it's all because of youI like 'em bad-bad, baby, you could be the one
And if you wanna get trashed and have fun
Throw me holy in the sky like a pizza pieYou take my whole world, baby, and twist it to the right
Throw it in the air and whoop like dynamite
Throw me in the sky like a pizza pieYou know I like 'em bad, boy
Wrong side of the track, boy

My baby used to dance underneath my architecture
To the houses of the holy
Smoking on them cigarettes
My baby used to dance underneath my architecture
He was cool as heck
He was cool as heck[Pre-Chorus]
But you were so obsessed with writing the next best American record
But there was nothing left by the time we got to bed
Baby that's a shame
You were so obsessed with writing the next best American record
You did it all for fame
You did it all for fame[Chorus 1]
You did it all for fame
Tell me how it treats you now
You did it all for fame
How does that taste coming out
You did it all for fame
Baby, how's life treating you now
It's over[Verse 2]
My baby used to dance underneath my architecture
He was seventies in spirit; nineties in his frame of mind
My baby used to dance underneath my architecture
We lost track of space
We lost track of time[Pre-Chorus]
But you were so obsessed with writing the next best American record
But there was nothing left by the time we got to bed
Baby that's a shame
You were so obsessed with writing the next best American record
You did it all for fame
You did it all for fame
(You know what I'm talking about)[Chorus 2]
You did it all for fame
Tell me how it treats you now
You did it all for fame
How does that taste coming out
Now that you lost the game
Honey, how's life treating you now
That it's over
Baby, how you feeling now
That I told you[Bridge]
It's true
All the roads lead to you
Everything I want and do
All the things that I say
It's true
All the roads lead to you
Like the 405 I drive through
Every night and every day
Ah, ah
I see you for who you really are
Why the thousands of girls
Love the way Bill plays guitar
Ah, ah[Chorus]
You did it all for fame
Tell me how it treats you now
You did it all for fame
How does that taste coming out
You did it all for fame
Honey, how you feeling now
That it's over
Baby, how's life treating you now
That I told you[Outro]
Honey, how is it feeling now?
(Honey, how's it feeling?, Honey, how's it feeling?)
I told you
(Honey, how's it feeling?, Honey, how's it feeling?)
I told youWith your big eyes
And your big lies
With your big eyesAnd your big lies
I saw you creeping around the garden
What are you hiding?
I beg your pardon don't tell me "nothing"
I used to think that I could trust you
I was your womanYou were my knight and shining companionTo my surprise my loves demise was his own greed and lullaby
With your big eyes, and your big liesWith your big eyes, and your big lies
I noticed you got hot in summer you had no comfort
Your shirt was cotton your face was sunburned
You paced around like you'd been waitingWaiting for something
Your world was burning and I stood watchingAs I looked on the flames grew high you watched me frownI said "goodbye"
With your big eyes, and your big liesWith your big eyes, and your big lies
Is it me was I wrong to have trusted you
Did I see what I wanted, what wasn't true?
Was I wrong to go on like a little fool?
It's amazing what women in love will do
With your big eyes
And your big lies
With your big eyes
And your big liesI paint my nails black
I dye my hair a darker shade
Of brown
Cause you like your women spanish dark, strong and proud
I paint the sky black
You said if you could have your way
You'd make a night time what today
So it'd suit the mood of your soulOh
What can I do
Nothing
My sparrow blueOh
What can I do
Life is beautiful
But you don't have a clue
Sun and ocean blue
Their magnificence

Walked into the room, you know you make my eyes burn
It was like James Dean for sure
You're so fresh to death and sick as cancer
You were sorta punk rock, I grew up on hip hop
But you fit me better than my favourite sweater
And I know that love is mean, and love hurts
But I still remember that day we met in December, oh babyI will love you 'til the end of time
I would wait a million years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby, can you see through the tears?
Love you more than those bitches before
Say you'll remember, say you'll remember

Baby, can you see through the tears?
Love you more than those bitches before

'Cause I'ma ride or die, whether you fail or fly
Well shit, at least you tried
But when you walked out the door a piece of me died
I told you I wanted more
That's not what I had in mind
I just want it like before
We were dancing all night
Then they took you away
Stole you out of my life
You just need to rememberI will love you 'til the end of time

Feeling the rapture grow
Like a flame burning brightly
But when she left gone was glow ofBlue velvet
But in my heart there'll always be
Precious and warm a memory
Through the yearsAnd I still can see blue velvet through my tearsEveryone from home

I've got a burning desire for you, baby
I've got a burning desireTime present and time past
Are both perhaps present in time future
And time future contained in time past
If all time is eternally present
All time is unredeemable
What might have been is an abstraction
Remaining a perpetual possibility
Only in a world of speculation
What might have been and what has been
Point to one end, which is always present
Footfalls echo in the memory
Down the passage which we did not take
Towards the door we never opened
Into the rose-garden...We're sippin' cocktails, looking down upon the riot,
You whisper "Baby, love the way you look tonight",
I wanna save you, save you from the world outsideI know it seems you're all I'm wanting and much more,
But then, to tell the truth, I've been through this before,
They say "I'll save you, save you", but they never doI think you know, I want to believe you,
But in my heart I know that I'll leave you.
It's sort of sad how instincts deceive you,
Or disappoints youEverything inside makes me wanna stay,
But everything you've done makes me wanna run run runI made the decision that I can't be with you,
I came out the door, but I already miss you,
Thinking about how I used to kiss you,
I-I'm getting butterflies, I-I'm getting butterfliesI made the decision that I'm too good for you,
Then I see you're calling, it's hard to ignore you
Try to be strong, but, babe, I adore you,
I-I'm getting butterflies, I-I'm getting butterfliesBack in high school, in the yard, we used to fight,
But you would sneak into my window every night,
"I wanna take you, take you to the world outside."Well, I assume it's what I wanted at the time,
But your eyes were like a constant warning sign,
"I wanna take you, take you" and I didn't mindAnd even though I didn't believe you,
You had a smile so easy to see through,
I know a little part of me will always needs you,
Try to reach you, try to please youEverything inside makes me wanna stay,
But everything you've done makes me wanna run run runI made the decision that I can't be with you,
I came out the door, but I already miss you,
Thinking about how I used to kiss you,
I-I'm getting butterflies, I-I'm getting butterfliesI made the decision that I'm too good for you,
Then I see you're calling, it's hard to ignore you
Try to be strong, but, babe, I adore you,
I-I'm getting butterflies, I-I'm getting butterfliesI know, I know, I know, we aren't good together
I can't let go, I'm sure that we should be foreverI look around, there's no one above you,
I think you know that I'll always love you.
And baby, I'm bad, too, it's not just you,
But I can't wait forever to trust youEverything inside makes me wanna stay,
But everything you've done makes me wanna run run runI made the decision that I can't be with you,
I came out the door, but I already miss you,
Thinking about how I used to kiss you,
I-I'm getting butterflies, I-I'm getting butterfliesI made the decision that I'm too good for you,
Then I see you're calling, it's hard to ignore you
Try to be strong, but, babe, I adore you,
I-I'm getting butterflies, I-I'm getting butterflies[Intro]
(One, two)[Verse 1]
You don't ever have to be stronger than you really are
When you're lying in my arms
Baby, you don't ever have to
Go faster than your fastest pace or faster than my fastest cars[Pre-Chorus]
I shouldn't have done it but I read it in your letter
You said to a friend that you wish you were doing better
I wanted to reach out but I never said a thing
I shouldn't have done it but I read it in your letter
You said to a friend that you wish you were doing better
I wanted to call you but I didn't say a thing
(Two, three, four)[Chorus]
Ooh, I'll pick you up
If you come back to America, just hit me up
'Cause this is crazy love
I'll catch you on the flipside
If you come back to California
You should just hit me up
We'll do whatever you want, travel wherever, have fun
We'll hit up all the old places
We'll have a party, we'll dance till dawn
I'll pick up all of your folks and all of your Rolling Stones
Your favorite liquor off the top-shelf
I'll throw a party, all night long[Verse 2]
You don't ever have to be stronger than you really are
When you're lying in my arms
And honey, you don't ever have to act cooler than you think you should
You're brighter than the brightest stars[Pre-Chorus]
You're scared to win, scared to lose
I've heard the war was over if you really choose
The one in and around you
You hate the heat, you got the blues
You're changing like the weather, oh, that's so like you
The same wind that moves you
(two, three, four)[Chorus]
Ooh, I'll pick you up
If you come back to America, just hit me up
'Cause this is crazy love
I'll catch you on the flipside
If you come back to California
You should just hit me up
We'll do whatever you want, travel wherever, have fun
We'll hit up all the old places
We'll have a party, we dance till dawn
I'll pick up all of your folks and all of your Rolling Stones
Your favorite liquor off the top-shelf
I'll throw a party, all night long[Outro]
Ooh, I'll pick you up
If you come back to America, just hit me up
'Cause this is crazy love
I'll catch you on the flipside
If you come back to California
You should just hit me upDarlin', darlin'
Doesn't have a problem lyin' to herself
'Cause her liquor's top shelf
It's alarmin', honestly, how charming she can be
Fooling everyone, telling 'em she's having funShe says, "You don't want to be like me
Don't wanna see all the things I've seen
I'm dying, I'm dying"
She says, "You don't want to get this way
Famous and dumb at an early age
Lying, I'm lying"The boys, the girls
They all like Carmen
She gives them butterflies, bats her cartoon eyes
She laughs like God
Her mind's like a diamond
Audiotune lies
She's still shinin'
Like lightning, woah
White lightningCarmen, Carmen
Stayin' up 'til morning
Only seventeen, but she walks the streets so mean
It's alarmin', truly, how disarmin' you can be
Eatin' soft ice cream
Coney Island queenShe says, "You don't want to be like me
Looking for fun, gettin' high for free
I'm dying, I'm dying"
She says, "You don't want to get this way
Street walk at night, and a star by day
It's tiring, tiring"The boys, the girls
They all like Carmen
She gives them butterflies, bats her cartoon eyes
She laughs like God
Her mind's like a diamond
Audiotune lies
She's still shinin'
Like lightning, woah
White lightningBaby's all dressed up with nowhere to go
That's the little story of the girl you know
Relyin' on the kindness of strangers
Tyin' cherry knots, smilin'
Doin' party favours
Put your red dress on, put your lipstick on
Sing your song, song, now the camera's on
And you're alive againMon amour, je sais que tu m'aimes aussi
Tu as besoin de moi, tu as besoin de moi dans ta vie
Tu ne peux vivre sans moi
Et je mourrais sans toi
Je tuerais pour toiThe boys, the girls
They all like Carmen
She gives them butterflies, bats her cartoon eyes
She laughs like God
Her mind's like a diamond
Audiotune lies
She's still shinin'
Like lightning, woah
White lightningLike lightning, woah
White lightning
Darlin', darlin'
Doesn't have a problem lyin' to herself
'Cause her liquor's top shelfEverything you do, everything I like
On the radio, dancing in the night
Flowers in my hair, roses on the vine
You can be my guy, and I'm your baby, right?My my, apple in my eye
Looking really hot while I'm making cherry pie
Show me what you got, got the sparkle in your eye
You're so highI'm yours and I'm free and I'm fun
I'm wild as can be, and I want
I want you boy, I want you boy
I'm cool and I'm calm with danger
This army of one and I caught
Caught you boy, I caught you boyEvery way I move, every way you like
Pulling on my dress, holding me too tight
I know we'll probably lose, only got tonight
But I love the way we kiss, love the way we fightMy, my, looking really fly
Like the way the bling on your pinkie ring shine
You spin me really fast and you catch me in the sky
I'm so highI'm yours and I'm free and I'm fun
I'm wild as can be, and I want
I want you boy, I want you boy
I'm cool and I'm calm with danger

I caught you, I caught youThere's somethin' in the wind, I can feel it blowin' in
It's comin' in softly on the wings of a bomb
There's somethin' in the wind, I can feel it blowin' in
It's comin' in hotly and it's comin' in strongLately, I've been thinkin' it's just someone else's job to care
Who am I to sympathize when no one gave a damn?
I've been thinkin' it's just someone else's job to care
Who am I to wanna try? ButChange is a powerful thing, people are powerful bein's
Tryin' to find the power in me to be faithful
Change is a powerful thing, I feel it comin' in me
Maybe by the time Summer's done
I'll be able to be honest, capable
Of holdin' you in my arms without lettin' you fall
When I don't feel beautiful or stable
Maybe it's enough to just be where we are becauseEvery time that we run, we don't know what it's from
Now we finally slow down, we feel close to it
There's a change gonna come
I don't know where or when
But whenever it does, we'll be here for itThere's somethin' in the wind, I can feel it blowin' in
It's comin' in softly on the wings of a song
There's somethin' in the water, I can taste it turnin' sour
It's bitter, I'm coughin'
But now it's in my bloodLately, I've been thinkin' it's just someone else's job to care
Who am I to sympathize when no one gave a damn?
I've been thinkin' it's just someone else's job to care
'Cause who am I to wanna try? ButChange is a powerful thing, people are powerful bein's
Tryin' to find the power in me to be faithful
Change is a powerful thing, I feel it comin' in me
Maybe by the time Summer's done
I'll be able to be honest, capable
Of holdin' you in my arms without letting you fall
When I don't feel beautiful or stable

Now we finally slow down, we feel close to it
There's a change gonna come
I don't know where or when
But whenever it does, we'll be here for itYeah, whenever it does, we'll be here for it
Whenever it does, we'll be here for itI remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel
You were talking so brave and so sweet
Giving me head on the unmade bed
While the limousines wait in the streetBut those were the reasons and that was New York
We were running for the money and the flesh
And that was called love for the workers in zone
Probably still is for those of them leftAh, but you got away, didn't you, baby?
You just turned your back on the crowd
You got away, I never once heard you say
I need you, I don't need you
I need you, I don't need you
And all of that jiving aroundI remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel
You were famous, your heart was a legend
You told me, again, you preferred handsome men
But for me you would make an exceptionAnd clenching your fist for the ones like us
Who are oppressed by the figures of beauty
You fixed yourself
You said, "Well, never mind
We are ugly, but we have the music"Oh, but you got away, didn't you, baby?
You just turned your back on the crowd
And you got away, I never once heard you say
I need you, I don't need you
I need you, I don't need ya
And all of that jiving aroundI don't mean to suggest that I loved you the best
I can't keep track of each fallen robin
I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel
That's all, I don't even think of you that oftenLove, I said real love is like feelin' no fear
When you're standin' in the face of danger
'Cause you just want it so much
A touch from your real love
Is like heaven takin' the place of somethin' evil
And lettin' it burn off from the rush, yeah, yeah
(Fuck!)Darlin', darlin', darlin'
I fall to pieces when I'm with you, I fall to pieces
My cherries and wine, rosemary and thyme
And all of my peaches are ruinedLove, is it real love?
It's like smilin' when the firin' squad's against you
And you just stay lined up, yeah
(Fuck!)Darlin', darlin', darlin'
I fall to pieces when I'm with you, I fall to pieces (bitch)
My cherries and wine, rosemary and thyme
And all of my peaches are ruined (bitch)My rose garden dreams, set on fire by fiends
And all my black beaches are ruined
My celluloid scenes are torn at the seams
And I fall to pieces (bitch)
I fall to pieces when I'm with you
(Why?)'Cause I love you so much, I fall to pieces
My cherries and wine, rosemary and thyme
And all of my peaches are ruined (bitch)
Are ruined (bitch)
Are ruined (fuck!)[Verse 1]
Cinnamon in my teeth
From your kiss
You're touching me
All the pills that you did
Violet, blue, green, red to keep me
At arm's length don't work
You try to push me out
But I just find my way back in
Violet, blue, green, red to keep me out
I win[Chorus]
There's things I wanna say to you
But I'll just let you live
Like if you hold me without hurting me
You'll be the first who ever did
There's things I wanna talk about
But better not to keep
But if you hold me without hurting me
You'll be the first who ever did[Post - Chorus]

Hold me, love me, touch me, honey
Be the first who ever didI was at Coachella, leanin' on your shoulder
Watchin' your husband swing in time
I guess I was in it, 'cause baby, for a minute
It was Woodstock in my mind
In the next mornin', they put out the warnin'
Tensions were rising over country lines
I turned off the music, tried to sit and use it
All of the love that I saw that night'Cause what about all these children
And what about all their parents?
And what about about all their crowns they wear
In hair so long like mine?
And what about all their wishes wrapped up like garland roses
Round their little heads?
I said a prayer for a third timeI'd trade it all for a stairway to heaven
(A stairway, stairway to heaven)
I'd take my time for the climb up to the top of it
(A stairway)
I'd trade the fame and the fortune and the legend
(A stairway)
I'd give it all away if you give me just one day
To ask him one question
I'd give it all away if you give me just one day
To ask him one questionI was at Coachella, leanin' on your shoulder
Watchin' your husband swing and shine
I'd say he was hella cool to win them over
Critics can be so mean sometimes
He was on his knees and I thought he was breaking 'em down
With his words and his voice divine
Doesn't take a genius to know what you've got going
And to not wanna lose it 'cause they lost their mindsWhat about all these children and all their children's children?
And why am I even wondering that today?
Maybe my contribution could be as small as hoping
That words could turn to birds
And birds would send my thoughts your wayI'd trade it all for a stairway to heaven
(A stairway, stairway to heaven)
I'd take my time for the climb up to the top of it
(A stairway)
I'd trade the fame and the fortune and the legend
(A stairway)
I'd give it all away if you give me just one day
To ask him one question
I'd give it all away if you give me just one day
To ask him one questionA stairway, stairway to heaven
A stairway
Got a million things I wanna say
Like what's it all for? Will it be okay?
Million things I wanna say
Like what's it all for?
Stairway, stairway to heaven
Stairway
Stairway, stairway to heaven

If sometimes you see that I'm mad
Don't you know no one alive can always be an angel?
When everything goes wrong you see some bad
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh, lord, please, don't let me be misunderstoodYou know sometimes baby I'm so carefree
With a joy that's hard to hide
And then sometimes again it seems that all I have is worry
And then you bound to see my other side
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh, lord, please, don't let me be misunderstoodIf I seem edgy
I want you to know
I never mean to take it out on you
Life has its problems
And I get more than my share
But that's one thing I never mean to do'Cause I love you
Oh, baby
I'm just human
Don't you know I have faults like anyone?Sometimes I find myself alone regretting
Some little foolish thing
Some simple thing that I've done
'Cause I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh, lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
I try so hard, don't let me be misunderstood.They say I'm wasting time,
They say that I'm no good.
Summer of my life,
Not doing what I should.Call me poison ivy,
'Cause I'm far from good,
Pretty from afar,
Like a dark star.They say I'm dangerous,
They think I'm really bad.
I'm just making up,
For what I never had.Go out every night,
Whenever I feel sad.
Oh, this drive by love,
Got me crazy like a drug.I wear my red lipstick,
Got my make up on,
Oh Miss America, now I'm gone baby goneI spent my whole life,
Driving in cars with boys.

Drinking in the white noise.
Used to talk about,
Where we'd be and,
Where we'd go,
Now we know,

Or Billy's pickup truck?

And baby picks me up.Tell them just drive on,
And d-don't ever stop!

Take me to a new land.I wear my red lipstick,
Grab my coat and gun.

Dance the night awayIt was a drive-by sunday night,
Most of us were in bed alright
I turned down the light,
Then I heard the sirens interrupt the silenceIs this what you wished,
To commit a crime?
Is this what you wished,
To commit a crime?
Is this what you wished,
To commit a crime, commit a crime, commit a crime?You was a nice guy, really bright,
Making money's hard to do right
Guilty was his plight,
Now he's in a jail cell first some 30 years nowIs this what you wished,
To be serving time?
Is this what you wished,
To be serving time, serving time, serving time?K's a friend of mine
I think about him as he does time
Miss his white wine,
Funny how I feel free even though it's not meIs this what you wished,
To leave me behind?
Is this what you wished,
To leave me behind, me behind, me behind?Last year they decided
That his time is up and then he got retried
Double homicide,
Sent him on a death row not to hang around, noIs this what you wished,
Did you wanna die?
Is this what you wished,
Did you wanna die?
Is this what you wished,
Did you wanna die, wanna die, wanna die?
Did you wanna die, wanna die, wanna die?All right, you got me

But, what do you want from me?
It's just a stupid bar
I didn't promise anything, noYou think I'm pretty and you like the way I talk
I like your music and you like the way I walk
So, I think we're gonna get alongI like the way you wear
Your sweater off your shoulder
The way your hair comes down
And makes you look older
How you get so handsome, my boy?Pretty baby, pretty babyThe way your face is shaped
I wonder if you know
The way you stand there
And your silhouette glows
I'm electrified, I'll be up all night nowUse that voice, sing that song
And tell me to come on, to come on, come on
You want here, no?
You want here, no?Pretty baby, pretty baby30 blocks to Fordham Road

Gray house on the corner
I know I shouldn't do what it is I couldThe stone Mary in the garden
She let me know she watching
She said I better get walking
I better walk awayI don't know why it is that I wanna stay,
I don't know what it is that makes me feel this way,
But I'm not gonna do what I hear me say,
I'm just gonna walk,
I'm gonna walk away.I catch a dollar in the wind and I buy a cup of coffee,
There's a place on Valentine that still charge ninety centsI keep on walking in the daytime, and in my eyes it's always nighttime
And I like it when it's me at night
'Cause that's when all the stars come outI don't know why it is that I wanna stay,
I don't know what it is that makes me feel this way,
But I'm not gonna do what I hear me say,
I'm just gonna walk,
I'm gonna walk away.it's the greatest
it's the greatest dayit's the greatest
it's the greatest dayI'm not gonna do what I hear me say,
I'm just gonna walk,
I'm gonna walk away.Flames so hot that they turn blue
Palms reflecting in your eyes,
Like an endless summer.
That's the way I feel for you.
If time stood still, I'd take this moment
Make it last forever.Your halo's full of fire.
I'm rising up, rising up.
My hot love's full of fire,
Love's full of fire.

I'm crossing the threshold
From the ordinary world
To the reveal of my heart
UndoubtedlyThat will for certain
Take the dead out of the sea
And the darkness from the artsThis is my commitment
My modern manifesto
I'm doin' it for all of us
Who never got the chanceFor... and for... (shut up, shut up)
And all my birds of paradise (shut up, shut up)
Who never got to fly at night (shut up, shut up)
'Cause they were caught up in the danceSometimes it feels like I've got a war in my mind
I want to get off, but I keep ridin' the ride
I never really noticed that I had to decideTo play someone's game or live my own life
And now I do
I wanna move
Out of the black (out of the black)
Into the blue (into the blue)FinallyGone is the burden
Of the crowdin' way of bein'
That comes from energies combined
Like my part was I
Was not discernin'
And you, as we found out
Were not in your right mindThere's no more chasin' rainbows
And hopin' for an end to them
Their arches are illusions
Solid at first glance
But then you try to touch them (touch, touch)
There's nothin' to hold on to (hold, hold)
The colors used to lure you in (shut up, shut up)
And put you in a trance (ah, ah, ah, yeah)Sometimes it feels like I've got a war in my mind
I want to get off, but I keep ridin' the ride
I never really noticed that I had to decide
To play someone's game or live my own life
And now I do
I wanna move
Out of the black (out of the black)
Into the blue (into the blue)
Out of the black (out of the black)
Into the blue (into the blue)
Out of the black (out of the black)
Into the blue (into the blue)Come back baby

To red, blue, and yellow skies
It's so crazy I could drink it like tequila sunrise
Put on that Hotel California
Dance around like I'm insane
I feel free when I see no one
And nobody knows my nameGod knows I live
God knows I died
God knows I begged
Begged, borrowed and cried
God knows I loved
God know I lied
God knows I lost
God gave me life
And God knows I tried
God knows I tried
God knows I tried
God knows I triedSometimes I wake up in the morning
To red, blue and yellow lights
On Monday they destroyed me
But by Friday I'm revived
Put on that hotel California
Wear my blinders in the rain
I've got nothing much to live for
Ever since I found my fameGod knows I live
God knows I died
God knows I loved
God knows I lied
God knows I begged
Begged, borrowed and cried
God knows I lost
God gave me life
God knows I tried
God knows I tried

I was an Angel.
Living in the garden of evil,
Screwed up, scared, doing anything that I Needed.
Shining like a fiery beacon,
You got that medicine I need
Fame, liquor, love, give it to me slowly.
Put your hands on my waist, do it softly.
Me and God we don't get along, so now I sing.No one's gonna take my soul away,
I'm living like Jim Morrison.
Headed towards a fucked up holiday.
Motel, squeeze, squeeze, and I'm singing;
Fuck yeah give it to me, this is heaven, what I Truly want
It's innocence lost. Innocence lost.In the land of gods and monsters,
I was an Angel,
Lookin' to get fucked hard.
Like a groupie incognito posing as a real singer,
Life imitates art
You got that medicine I need
Dope, shoot it up straight to the heart please
I don't really wanna know what's good for me
God's dead, I said 'baby that's alright with me'.No one's gonna take my soul away,
Living like Jim Morrison.
Headed towards a fucked up holiday.
Motel, sprees, sprees, and I'm singing;
Fuck yeah give it to me, this is heaven, what I Truly want
It's innocence lost. Innocence lost.When you talk it's like a movie
Making me go crazy
'Cause life imitates art
If I'll get a little pretty
Can I be your baby?
And tell me life isn't that hard.No one's gonna take my soul away,
Living like Jim Morrison.
Headed towards a fucked up holiday.

We met with a goodbye kiss
I broke my wristIt all kicked off
I had no choice
You said that you didn't mind
'Cause love's hard to findMaybe the days we had are gone
Living in silence for too long
Open your eyes and what do you see?
No more laughs
No more photographsTurning slowly
Looking back, see
No words
Can save this
You're broken
And I'm pissed
Run along
Like I'm supposed to
Be the man
I ought to
Rock and Roll
Sent us insane
I hope someday that we will meet againRunning wild
Giving it everyone
Now that's all doneMaybe the days we had are gone

I hope someday that we will meet againYou're in the bar, playin' guitar
I'm tryin' not to let the crowd next to me
It's so hard sometimes with the star
When you have to share him with everybody
You're in the club, livin' it up
I'm tryin' not to let the crowd notice me
It's so sweet, swingin' to the beat

I know what you're thinkin' of
I know what you're thinkin' ofYou want my
Groupie love

Groupie loveTime after time, writin' my lines
Havin' my baby there next to me
It's so sweet, pourin' you a drink
And pretendin' that nothin' means anything
This is my life, you by my side
Key lime and perfume and festivals
Takin' our dreams, turnin' them to things

I should have learned to let you stay
You didn't want me all the time
But you were worth it anyway
Cause you were so much better
Than the rest of them
Out of all the others
You were the honest manHe loved guns and roses, guns and roses
He loved guns and roses, he loved guns
And roses, roses, rosesMotorcycle love divine
I should have learned to let you play
I wasn't the marrying kind
I should have done it anyway
We should have left Las Vegas
And then began again
To get back to Detroit
Back to the promised landHe loved guns and roses, guns and roses
He loved guns and roses, he loved guns
And roses, roses, rosesI can feel it coming in the air tonight
See you walking on the blue Pacific,
I can see you bathing in the summer light
Turnin' tan, I'm in love to
Turning tan in your left, I think
You got game boy, game boy
You got game boy, game boy
You got game boy, game boy
You got gameHe loved guns and roses, guns and roses
He loved guns and roses, he loved guns
And roses, roses, roses[Intro]
Do you want me or do you not?
I heard one thing, now I'm hearing another
Dropped a pin to my parking spot
The bar was hot, it's 2 a.m., it feels like summer[Verse 1]
Happiness is a butterfly
Try to catch it like every night
It escapes from my hands into moonlight
Everyday is a lullaby
I hum it on the phone, like every night
And sing it for my babies on the tour life
Ah-ah[Pre-Chorus]
If he's a serial killer then what's the worst
That could happen to a girl, who's already hurt?
I'm already hurt
If he's as bad as they say, then I guess I'm cursed
Looking into his eyes, I think he's already hurt
He's already hurt[Chorus]
I said, "Don't be a jerk, don't call me a taxi"
Sitting in your sweatshirt, crying in the backseat
Ooh, oh-oh
I just wanna dance with you
Hollywood and Vine, Black Rabbit in the alley
I just wanna hold you tight down the avenue
Ooh, oh-oh
I just wanna dance with you
I just wanna dance with you[Post-Chorus]
Baby I just wanna dance with you
(Dance, with you, dance)
Baby I just wanna dance with you
(Dance, with you)[Interlude]
Left the canyon, drove to the club
I was one thing, now I'm being another
Go down to Sunset in my truck
I'll pick you up if you're in town, I'm coming
Ah-ah[Verse 2]
Happiness is a butterfly
We should catch it while dancing
I lose myself in the music, baby
Everyday is a lullaby
Try to catch it like lightning
I sing it into my music, I'm crazy[Pre-Chorus]
If he's a serial killer then what's the worst
That could happen to a girl, who's already hurt?
I'm already hurt
If he's as bad as they say, then I guess I'm cursed
Looking into his eyes, I think he's already hurt
He's already hurt[Chorus]
I said, "Don't be a jerk, don't call me a taxi"
Sitting in your sweatshirt, crying in the backseat
Ooh, oh-oh
I just wanna dance with you
Hollywood and Vine, Black Rabbit in the alley
I just wanna hold you tight down the avenue
Ooh, oh-oh
I just wanna dance with you
I just wanna dance with you[Post-Chorus]
Baby I just wanna dance with you
(Dance, with you, dance)
Baby I just wanna dance with you
(Dance, with you)[Outro]
With youHawaiian tropic, dark and a bottle of jack
In the Cadillac as I drive down the highway
You aren't coming back and I know that now
so I let the wind hit me in my faceEvery man gets his wish, every man gets his wishYour red hawaiian shirt and your hair jet black
Hangin' round with your friends by the track
Baby, you can't come back from being that bad
Just to sit at home, pledge allegiance to the flagEvery man gets his wish, every man gets his wish
You told me this, now you're goneCopacabana, yes, in my party dress,
I'm shimmering in love on that crystal meth
A Coca Cola kid, roller coaster child
You my everything, give me that baby doll smileEvery man gets his wish, every man gets his wish
You told me this, where is mine?
Every man gets his wish, every man gets his wish
You told me this, were you lying?And the Velvet Elvis and the rosaries
And your white Corvette under willow trees
You the one for me, my one true kingEvery man gets his wish, every man gets his wish
You told me this, now you're gone
Every man gets his wish, every man gets his wish
You told me this, now you're goneI remember,
(Every man gets his wish),
Party dresses
(Every man gets his wish),
I remember,
(Every man gets his wish),
Party dresses
(Now you're gone)Every man gets his wish, every man gets his wish
But sometimes it comes too lateTopanga is hot tonight, the city by the bay
Has movie stars and liquor stores and soft decay
The rumblin' from distant shores sends me to sleep
But the facts of life can sometimes make it hard to dreamLife rocked me like Moetley
Grabbed me by the ribbons in my hair
Life rocked me ultra-softly
Like the heavy metal that you wearI'm flyin' to the moon again, dreamin' about heroin
How it gave you everything and took your life away
I put you on an aeroplane, destined for a foreign land
I hoped that you'd come back again
And tell me everything's okay, ay
Babe, yeahTopanga's hot today, Manson's in the air
And all my friends have come, 'cause they still feel him here
I want to leave, I'll probably stay another year
It's hard to leave when absolutely nothin's clearLife rocked me like Moetley
Bad beginnin' to my new year
Life rocked me ultra-softly
Like the heavy metal that you hearI'm flyin' to the moon again, dreamin' about heroin
And how it gave you everything and took your life away
I put you on the aeroplane, destined for a foreign land
I thought that you'd come back again
To tell me everything's okay, ay
Babe, yeah(It's fuckin' hot, hot) Winter in the city
Somethin' 'bout this weather made these kids go crazy
(It's hot) Even for February
Somethin' 'bout this sun has made these kids get scary
Oh, writin' in blood on my walls and shit
Like, "Oh my God"
Drippin' off from the walls into the ducts and shit
Oh, ho ho ho, I'd be lyin' if I said I wasn't sick of it
Lead me (baby) come on (come on) come on (come on)I'm flyin' to the moon again, dreamin' about marzipan
Taking all my medicine to take my thoughts away
I'm getting on that aeroplane, leavin' my old man again
I hope that I come back one day
To tell you that I really changed, baby(It's hot, hot) Somethin' 'bout the city
Don't know what it is, it make's my head get crazy
Oh, makes me feel like I can change
Oh, ho ho ho, all of my evil ways and shit
Oh, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't sick of it[Intro]
Do, do
Ah, ah
I said[Chorus]
Hey you, what you doing?
I think you could probably be my baby, baby
Hey you, what you doing?
I think you could probably be my baby, baby
I know that it's wrong but no one can save me[Verse 1]
He's walked with the past
Life of the fast
Girls in the fast lane
His knuckles are brass
A heart like a horse
Love of the games, gold in his veins[Pre-Chorus 1]
Met him at the club
Singing my songs
He says,Boy, look at you looking at me
I know you know how I feel
Loving you is hard, being here is harder
You take the wheel
I don't wanna do this anymore
It's so surreal, I can't survive
If this is all that's realAll I wanna do is get high by the beach
Get high by the beach, get high
All I wanna do is get by by the beach
Get by baby, baby, bye, bye

But that don't make you a man
Now you're just another one of my problems
Because you got out of hand
We won't survive
We're sinking into the sand
All I wanna do is get high by the beach
Get high by the beach, get high

You'll be my first, and you'll be my last.In Hollywood,

I'm alive again.my kind of love
It was once in a lifetime
It couldn't last
It was doomed from the first timeAnd you were 50s cool
In blue suede shoes
But it was a cover for all of the trouble
You got intoI always fall for the wrong guy
Things that are bad always taste nice
That's what girls like me do
Lose youDon't tell me it's over
Don't tell me it's over
Hollywood's dead
Elvis is crying
Vicious in flames
Bolin/Bolan[?] is dying
And in the light you're sickeningly beautiful
Say goodbye, you're sickeningly beautifulThis kind of life
Wasn't meant for the good girl
Try as I might
In the end, it's a cruel worldAnd you are living proof
Sinatra aloof
That you were an actor who only went after
The ones who swoonedI always fall for the same type
Gangsters in Vegas on game night
That's what girls like me like
The limelightDon't tell me it's over
Don't tell me it's over
Hollywood's dead
Elvis is crying
Marilyn's sad
Hendrix is lying there
In the light you're sickeningly beautiful
Say goodbye, you're sickeningly beautifulIf you should go before me then know
That I always loved you
There's no one above you, babyDon't tell me it's over
Don't tell me it's over
Hollywood's dead
Elvis is crying
Lennon, wake up
Cobain, stop lying there
In the light you're sickeningly beautiful
Say goodbye, you're sickeningly beautiful
Say goodnight, you're so beautiful
Hollywood's dead
Hollywood's dead
Hollywood's dead
Yeah
Hollywood's dead
Hollywood's dead
Hollywood's dead
Yeah
(Cut!)We both know that it's not fashionable to love me

Dreaming away your life[Verse 1]
I was reading Slim Aarons and I got to thinking that I thought
Maybe I'd get less stressed if I was tested less like
All of these debutantes
Smiling for miles in pink dresses and high heels on white yachts
But I'm not, baby, I'm not
No, I'm not, that, I'm not[Chorus]
I've been tearing around in my fucking nightgown
24/7 Sylvia Plath
Writing in blood on the walls
'Cause the ink in my pen don't work in my notepad
Don't ask if I'm happy, you know that I'm not
But at best I can say I'm not sad
'Cause hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have
Hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have[Verse 2]
I had fifteen-year dances
Church basement romances, yeah, I've cried
Spilling my guts with the Bowery Bums
Is the only love I've ever known
Except for the stage, which I also call home, when I'm not
Servin' up God in a burnt coffee pot for the triad
Hello, it's the most famous woman you know on the iPad
Calling from beyond the grave, I just wanna say, "Hi, Dad"[Chorus]
I've been tearing up town in my fucking white gown
Like a goddamn near sociopath
Shaking my ass is the only thing that's
Got this black narcissist off my back
She couldn't care less, and I never cared more
So there's no more to say about that
Except hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have
Hope is a dangerous thing for a woman with my past[Bridge]
There's a new revolution, a loud evolution that I saw
Born of confusion and quiet collusion of which mostly I've known
A modern day woman with a weak constitution, 'cause I've got
Monsters still under my bed that I could never fight off
A gatekeeper carelessly dropping the keys on my nights off[Chorus]
I've been tearing around in my fucking nightgown
24/7 Sylvia Plath
Writing in blood on your walls
'Cause the ink in my pen don't look good in my pad
They write that I'm happy, they know that I'm not
But at best, you can see I'm not sad
But hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have
Hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have[Outro]
Hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have
But I have it
Yeah, I have it
Yeah, I have it
I have[Verse 1]
John met me down at the boulevard
Cry on his shoulder 'cause life is hard
The waves came in over my head
What you been up to my baby?
Haven't seen you 'round here lately
All of the guys tell me lies but you don't
You just crack another beer
And pretend that you're still here[Chorus]
This is how to disappear
This is how to disappear[Verse 2]
Jim met me down at the training yard
Got cuts on his face 'cause he fought too hard
I know he's in over his head
But I love that man like nobody can
He moves mountains and turns them to ground again
And I watched the guys getting high as they fight
For the things that they hold dear
To forget the things they fear[Chorus - Variation]
And this is how they disappear
This is how they disappear[Bridge]
Well now, it's been years since I left New York
And I've got a kid and two cats in the yard
The California sun and the movie stars
And I watched the skies getting light as I write
As I think about those years
And I whisper in your ear[Outro]
I'm always going to be right here
No one's going anywhere
I'm always going to be right here
No one's going anywhereHundred dollar bill, hundred dollar bill

You had me caged up like a burning red summer
You saw me waiting, I was crazy, I'm fire awaiting to fly
I, can flyI had pride, wishes in the summer, I was bathing in sunlight,
Painting in the garden, like a ghost in meteor light,
Running fast from something with my eyes wide, like so suspended in the sunI had a dream that I was fine,
I wasn't crazy, I was divineI, can fly,
You had me caged up like a burning red summer
You saw me waiting, I was crazy, I'm fire awaiting to fly
I, can flyYour lies were hard, kisses in the summer
I was dreaming of a lake, dreaming of the water where I'd rise like a phoenix
Sore and iron from the fire, I've got things to tell you, like, I know that you're a liarI had a dream that I was fine,
I wasn't crazy, I was divineI, can fly,
You had me caged up like a burning red summer
You saw me waiting, I was crazy, I'm fire awaiting to fly
I, can flyYour words cut like a knife in butter
I was fighting for my art, fighting with my lover
Thinking there's no water
Yeah, right
Yeah, rightI, can fly,

You saw me waiting, I was crazy, I'm fire awaiting to fly
I, can flyHe don't like no small things,
Even riding around on tall dreams.
I don't want to go.
He's a sweet baby, but he looks mean
In his soft leather, in his blue jeans
He got away, baby, he got away, oh, baby
He got away with his words.

Well I must be stupid for feeling so happy
I must be crazy for calling you mine
My life's like a movie but I just let it move me
So slow like a two-step, you hold me real tight[Chorus]
All my friends say my life's
Like a bad country song
I just smile, say "I know, but I like to sing along"
For the sweet wedding days
I just put Hank Williams on
I must be stupid for feeling so happy
But they can call me what they want[Verse 2]
They think I'm crazy but I keep laughing
They think I'm funny for wearing a smile
But it's just in my nature and it's just how you move me
Real slow like a movie and I wanna rewind[Chorus]
All my friends say my life's
Like a bad country song
I just smile, say "I know, but I like to sing along"
For the sweet wedding days
I just put Hank Williams on

You got me in the back of your car

Sparkling when the lights are on.
But when the night time comes,
And all the lights turn off,
You turn off with them.(Where do you go when)
(The lights turn low, boy)?You're like an old film reel,
Kissing me when the crowd can watch.
But when the velvet falls,
And the projector coughs,
I can be sure you're gone.(You say it's not true),
(But I know how you do, boy).I'm like a child,
Who belongs to nobody,
So I wear you like my clothes,
Hold you close to my body,
Because you hurt so good,
Feel so bad, honey, I just,
Want you to want me,
Want you to want me.You're like a fake diamond,
Sparkling in the moon and sun.
You shine like the only one,
But when the darkness comes,
Baby, you're on the run.(Where do you go when),
(The lights turn low, boy)?You're like my ex-boyfriend,
Kissing me when the camera's on.
I'm candy for your arm,
Look like a debutante.
But I'm not what you want.(You say it's not true),
(But I know how you do, boy).I'm like a child,

Don't you wanna fall in love?
No such thing as heaven
And I'm the last girl on Earth
So, baby, let's get it onI stay up late at night

On display somehow
Sometimes I get lonely

But that's no reason to give up
Don't you wanna fall in love?

Even when the sun goes downTook a trip to San Francisco
All our friends said we would jive
Didn't work, so I left for Fresno
It was quite a scenic drive
Pulled over to watch the children in the park
We used to only worry for them after darkI'm still looking for my own version of America
One without the gun, where the flag can freely fly
No bombs in the sky, only fireworks when you and I collide
It's just a dream I had in mind
It's just a dream I had in mind
It's just a dream I had in mindI flew back to New York City
Missed that Hudson River line
Took a train up to Lake Placid
That's another place and time, where
I used to go to drive-ins and listen to the blues
So many things that I think twice about before I do, noI'm still looking for my own version of America
One without the gun, where the flag can freely fly
No bombs in the sky, only fireworks when you and I collide
It's just a dream I had in mind
It's just a dream I had in mind
It's just a dream I had in mindIt's just a dream I had in mindLook at you kids with your vintage music
Comin' through satellites while cruisin'
You're part of the past, but now you're the future
Signals crossing can get confusingIt's enough just to make you feel crazy, crazy, crazy
Sometimes, it's enough just to make you feel crazyYou get ready, you get all dressed up
To go nowhere in particular
Back to work or the coffee shop
Doesn't matter cause it's enough
To be young and in love (ah, ah)
To be young and in love (ah, ah)Look at you kids, you know you're the coolest
The world is yours and you can't refuse it
Seen so much, you could get the blues
But that don't mean that you should abuse itThough It's enough just to make you go crazy, crazy, crazy
I know, it's enough just to make you go crazy, crazy, crazyBut you get ready, you get all dressed up

In the car, in the car, in the backseat, I'm your baby
We go fast, we go so fast, we don't move
I believe in a place you take me
Make you real proud of your baby
In your car, I'm a star and I'm burnin' through you
In your car, I'm a star and I'm burnin' through you[Chorus]
Oh, be my once in a lifetime
Lying on your chest, in my party dress
I'm a fucking mess but I
Oh, thanks for the high life
Baby, it's the best, that's a test
And yes, now I'm here with you and I
Would like to think that you would stick around
You move, but I just got to make you proud
The taste, the touch, the way we love
It all comes down to make the sound of a love song[Verse 2]
Dream a dream, here's a scene
Touch me anywhere 'cause I'm your baby
Grab my waist, don't waste any part
I believe that you see me for who I am
So spill my clothes on the floor of your new car
Is it safe, is it safe, to just be who we are?
Is it safe, is it safe, to just be who we are?[Chorus]
Oh, be my once in a lifetime
Lying on your chest, in my party dress
I'm a fucking mess but I
Oh, thanks for the high life
Baby, it's the best, that's a test
And yes, now I'm here with you and I
Would like to think that you would stick around
You move, but I just got to make you proud

It all comes down to make the sound of a love song[Outro]
The taste, the touch, the way we love
It all comes down to make the sound of a love songLet's get out of this town, baby we're on fire
Everyone around here seems to be going down, down, down
If you stick with me, I can take you higher, and higher
It feels like all of our friends are lost
Nobody's found, found, foundI got so scared, I thought no one could save me
You came along scooped me up like a babyEvery now and then the stars align
Boy and girl meet by the great design
Could it be that you and me are the lucky ones?Everybody told me love was blind
Then I saw your face and you blew my mind
Finally, you and me are the lucky ones this timeBoy, get into my car, got a bad desire
You know that we'll never leave if we don't get out now, now, now
You're a careless con, and you're a crazy liar
But baby, nobody can compare to the way you get down, down, downI tried so hard to act nice like a lady
You taught me that it was good to be crazyEvery now and then the stars align
Boy and girl meet by the great design
Could it be that you and me are the lucky ones?Everybody told me love was blind
Then I saw your face and you blew my mind
Finally, you and me are the lucky ones this timeFeels like, feels like, you know,
It feels like falling in love for the first time
Feels like, you know,

In these stolen moments, the world is mine (duwop, duwop)
There's nobody here, just us together (shuwop, shuwop)
Keeping me hot like July forever'Cause we're the masters of our own fate
We're the captains of our own souls
There's no way for us to come away
'Cause boy we're gold, boy we're gold
And I was like...Take off, take off
Take off all your clothes

They say only the good die young
That just ain't right
'Cause we're having too much fun

'Til we run out of breath, gotta dance 'til we die (duwop, duwop)
My boyfriend's back and he's cooler than ever (shuwop, shuwop)
There's no more night, blue skies forever'Cause we're the masters of our own fate
We're the captains of our own souls
So there's no need for us to hesitate
We're all alone, let's take control
And I was like...Take off, take off

I regress back to the one that I can't see
There's someone I have never talked about
I know that we'd both we dead if you found outEvery time you tell me that I'm wrong
I just can't remember how to play along
There's something I have never told you
I'm not really from this world
There's something I have been withholding
I'm not like every other girlLa la mahi mahi la la
La la mahi mahi la la
You are the man of my dreams that I've waited for
You are the man of my dreams that I've waited forSo if you begin to think that my light might be supernatural
I'd have to say alright, you're right mon cher it is
I come from a place that your mind cannot even imagine
Where we sing Maha, Maha, Maha, MahaLa la mahi mahi la la
La la mahi mahi la la
You are the man of my dreams that I've waited for
You are the man of my dreams that I've waited forWhere we sing Maha, oh Maha, oh Maha, MahaI give my life back
I'm your devoted
I give my love babe
I'm your devoted
Maha Maha, Maha Maha, Maha, Maha[Verse 1]
You took my sadness out of context
At the Mariners Apartment Complex
I ain't no candle in the wind
I'm the board, the lightning, the thunder
Kind of girl who's gonna make you wonder
Who you are and who you've been[Pre-Chorus 1]
And who I've been is with you on these beaches
Your Venice bitch, your die-hard, your weakness
Maybe I could save you from your sins
So, kiss the sky and whisper to Jesus
My, my, my, you found this, you need this
Take a deep breath, baby, let me in[Chorus]
You lose your way, just take my hand
You're lost at sea, then I'll command your boat to me again
Don't look too far, right where you are, that's where I am
I'm your man
I'm your man[Verse 2]
They mistook my kindness for weakness
I fucked up, I know that, but Jesus
Can't a girl just do the best she can?
Catch a wave and take in the sweetness
Think about it, the darkness, the deepness
All the things that make me who I am[Pre-Chorus 2]
And who I am is a big-time believer
That people can change, but you don't have to leave her
When everyone's talking, you can make a stand
'Cause even in the dark I feel your resistance
You can see my heart burning in the distance
Baby, baby, baby, I'm your man (yeah)[Chorus]
You lose your way, just take my hand
You're lost at sea, then I'll command your boat to me again
Don't look too far, right where you are, that's where I am
I'm your man
I'm your man[Outro]
Catch a wave and take in the sweetness
Take in the sweetness
You want this, you need this
Are you ready for it?
Are you ready for it?
Are you ready for it?Understand this, I'm not looking
For true love tonight
If you wanna be my little baby
You can meet me in the pale moonlightI've been working everyday eight to nine and
Servin' coke and fries at the movie blue drive-in
If you want me you know where to find meI can be your one time baby

I don't wanna care tonight, I don't wanna fight
You don't have to give me anything
Just put your sweet kiss kiss on my lips now babyUnderstand this, I've been liking
You since I was small
I don't wanna get you running scared
When there's no pressure there at allI've been working eight to nine everyday and
Think about you almost all the time, all the time and
If I want to see you I drive byI can be your one time baby
I can be your little dairy queen
I don't wanna care tonight, I don't wanna fight

Buy a white sweater, for the last white day
Of the summerBuy my purple wig for my mermaid video

In my motel
On Neptune (Avenue)You call me lavender, you call me sunshine

For the sixth page
We're on a quick, sick rampage
Wining and dining, drinking and driving
Excessive buying, overdose and dying
On our drugs, and our love, and our dreams, and our rage
Blurring the lines between real and the fake
Dark and lonely, I need somebody to hold me
He will do very well
I can tell, I can tell
Keep me safe in his belltower hotelMoney is the anthem of success
So put on mascara and your party dressI'm your national anthem
Boy, put your hands up
Give me a standing ovation
Boy, you have landed
Babe, in the land of sweetness and danger
Queen of SaigonTell me I'm your national anthem
Booyah, baby, bow, down
Making me so wow now
Tell me I'm your national anthem
Sugar, sugar, how now

Money is the anthem of success

It's a game boy
I don't wanna play

Put your foot to the floor
Really walk away
Tell me that you need me more and more everyday
Never let me go, just stay[Verse 1]
Goddamn, man-child
You fucked me so good that I almost said, "I love you"
You're fun and you're wild
But you don't know the half of the shit that you put me through
Your poetry's bad and you blame the news
But I can't change that, and I can't change your mood
Ah-ah[Chorus]
'Cause you're just a man
It's just what you do
Your head in your hands
As you color me blue
Yeah, you're just a man
All through and through
Your head in my hands
As you color me blue
Blue, blue, blue[Verse 2]
Goddamn, man-child
You act like a kid even though you stand six foot two
Self-loathing poet, President Moro, can you know it all?
You talk to the walls when the party gets bored of you
But I don't get bored, just see you through
Why wait for the best when I could have you?
You-oh-oh[Chorus]
'Cause you're just a man
It's just what you do
Your head in your hands
As you color me blue
Yeah, you're just a man
All through and through
Your head in my hands
As you color me blue
Blue, blue[Outro]
You make me blue
Blue, blue, blue
Blue, blue, blueMy old man is a bad man, but
I can't deny the way he holds my hand
And he grabs me, he has me by my heart
He doesn't mind I have a Las Vegas past
He doesn't mind I have a LA crass way about me
He loves me with every beat of his cocaine heart
Swimming pool glimmering, darling
White bikini off with my red nail polish
Watch me in the swimming pool
Bright blue ripples
You sitting, sipping on your Black Cristal, oh yeahLight of my life, fire of my loins
Be a good baby, do what I want
Light of my life, fire of my loins
Gimme them gold coins
Gimme them coinsAnd I'm off to the races
Cases of Bacardi chasers
Chasing me all over town
'Cause he knows I'm wasted
Facing time again at Rikers Island
And I won't get out
Because I'm crazy, baby
I need you to come here and save me
I'm your little scarlet, starlet
Singing in the garden
Kiss me on my open mouth
Ready for youMy old man is a tough man, but
He's got a soul as sweet as blood red jam
And he shows me, he knows me
Every inch of my tar-black soul
He doesn't mind I have a flat broke-down life
In fact he says he thinks it's what he might like about me
Admires me, the way I roll like a rolling stone
Likes to watch me in the glass room, bathroom, Chateau Marmont
Slipping on my red dress, putting on my makeup
Glass room, perfume, cognac, lilac fumes
Says it feels like heaven to himLight of his life, fire of his loins
Keep me forever, tell me you own me
Light of your life, fire of your loins
Tell me you own me
Gimme them coinsAnd I'm off to the races
Cases of Bacardi chasers
Chasing me all over town
'Cause he knows I'm wasted
Facing time again at Rikers Island
And I won't get out
Because I'm crazy, baby
I need you to come here and save me
I'm your little scarlet, starlet
Singing in the garden
Kiss me on my open mouthYo, I'm off to the races, laces
Leather on my waist is tight and I am falling down
I can see your face is shameless
Cipriani's Basement
Love you, but I'm going down
God, I'm so crazy, baby
I'm sorry that I'm misbehaving
I'm your little harlot, starlet
Queen of Coney Island
Raising hell all over town
Sorry 'bout itMy old man is a thief, and
I'm gonna stay and pray with him 'til the end
But I trust in the decision of the Lord
To watch over us
Take him when he may, if He may
I'm not afraid to say that I'd die without him
Who else is gonna put up with me this way?
I need you, I breathe you, I'll never leave you
They would rue the day, I was alone without you
You're lying with your gold chain on
Cigar hanging from your lips
I said, "Hon', you never looked so beautiful
As you do now, my man"And we're off to the races, places
Ready, set, the gate is down
And now we're going in
To Las Vegas, chaos
Casino Oasis
Honey, it is time to spin
Boy, you're so crazy, baby
I love you forever, not maybe
You are my one true love
You are my one true loveYou are my one true loveOh, say can you see my stars
The night time is almost ours
To wander through alleys and look at the bars
Night time is almost oursThe headlights from passing cars
They illuminate my face then they've made the dark
The voice of Nirvana says, "Come as you are"
And I will
The night time is almost oursA sway of the hips and arms
We'll cradle you from afar
They swing till you tire and send it alarms
Night time is almost oursBlue hydrangea, cold cash divine
Cashmere, cologne and white sunshine
Red racing cars, Sunset and Vine
The kids were young and pretty
Where have you been? Where did you go?
Those summer nights seem long ago
And so is the girl you used to call
The Queen of New York CityBut if you send for me, you know I'll come
And if you call for me, you know I'll run
I'll run to you, I'll run to you
I'll run, run, run
I'll come to you, I'll come to you
I'll come, come, comeThe power of youth is on my mind
Sunsets, small town, I'm out of time
Will you still love me when I shine?
From words but not from beauty
My father's love was always strong
My mother's glamour lives on and on
Yet still inside, I felt alone
For reasons unknown to meBut if you send for me, you know I'll come
And if you call for me, you know I'll run
I'll run to you, I'll run to you
I'll run, run, run
I'll come to you, I'll come to you
I'll come, come, comeAnd if you call
I'll run, run, run
If you change your mind
I'll come, come, comeBlue hydrangea, cold cash divine
Cashmere, cologne and hot sunshine
Red racing cars, Sunset and Vine
And we were young and prettyYou, you light my red fire babe
Hot white, and blue.
And I, I think that you,
I think you're so cool babe
Loving everything you do.You say we're gonna run away
Put on your sundress, summer day
Flying around on the highway.Spin me 'round, kiss me in your Chevrolet.
I love you more with each and everyday.
Top down, gonna make a getaway, top down.
Spin me 'round, kiss me in your Chevrolet.
You found me when I had lost my way.
Foot down, we're going all the way, touchdown.
Gonna make a getaway, top down.You, know what I want.
Take me to the K-Mart, pick me up pink lip-gloss.
How, you get so hot
You're making me crazy
Hoping you'll never stop.You say that we were meant to be.
We'll be together finally.
Flying around and I'm finally free, oh.Spin me 'round, kiss me in your Chevrolet.
I love you more with each and everyday.
Top down, finally gonna get away, top down.
Spin me 'round, kiss me in your Chevrolet.
You found me when I had lost my way.
Foot down, we're going all the way, touchdown.We're on our way
We're on our way

We're on our wayWhy, did I think too much?
You tell me not to worry
Because you're the boss.
And you, you got a real good plan
My trouble's all over now
Because you're my man.You don't know what you've done to me.
You're heavier than heavenly.
Life on the run has set me free, me free now.We're on our way...You tell me not to worry
Because you're the boss.I know you
I walked with you once upon a dream.
I know you
That look in your eyes is so familiar a gleamAnd I know it's true

Text me when you get home safely
Like you always did
When we was first datingYou're sitting in your office dreaming of a different life
You say you wanna make me smile and see my wild side
If we don't leave town now
We're never gonna get out of here alive
I'm walking home from school my thoughts are drifting into space
Why don't we leave tonight and take off to a different place
Don't tell my daddy why, gotta get on that plane and just flyTake me to Paris
Let's go there and never look back

You're such a naughty boy
Why you taking that Polaroid
Put on a show you'll enjoy
Take me to Paris
(Ooh la la, ooh la la)
(Ooh la la, ooh la la)I wanna be that fantasy that you got on your mind
Flying across the sea to somewhere that they'll never find
We should go out while we're young
Cause one day we will want to rewind...Our time in Paris
Take me to Yves Saint Laurent
Paris, make out in a dark restaurant
We'll dance until we die
Wanna go out every night

When we was first datingWell, I didn't know it would come to this
But that's what happens when you're on your own
And you're alright letting nice things goWell, I pawned the earrings that you gave me
Gold and made of flowers dangling
And I almost cried as I sold them all
And I don't mind living on bread and oranges, no no
But I gotta get to and from where I come
And it's gonna take money to go
Oh, noOh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh...
In the name of higher consciousness
I let the best man I knew go
'Cause it's nice to love and be loved
But it's better to know all you can know
I said it's nice to love and be loved
But I'd rather know what God knowsOh, no
Oh, no
Oh, noOh, no
Oh, no
I can't do this once more
No man can keep me together
Been broken since I was born
Well, I didn't know it would come to this
But that's what happens when you're on your own
And you're alright letting nice things goPin up girls at the roller derby,

Well I can't envision, that for a minute
When I'm down on my knees, you're how I pray
I need your love
I need your love
I need your loveEverything is bright now
No more cloudy days, even when
The storms come, in the eye we'll stay
No need to survive now
All we do is play, all I hear is
Music like Lay Lady LayIt never was about the money or the drugs
For you there's only love
For you there's only love
It never was about the party or the clubs
For you there's only loveCause you're my religion
You're how I'm living
When all my friends say I should take some space
Well I can't envision, that for a minute
When I'm down on my knees, you're how I pray
I need your love
I need your love
I need your love
You're my religion
You're how I'm living
When all my friends say I should take some space
Well I can't envision, that for a minute
When I'm down on my knees, you're how I[Verse 1]
Oh baby, when you call me, I come to
From dreams I'll wake, and I'm waiting for you
Oh baby, when you call me, I come to
I jump through hula hoops of fire just to get to you[Pre-Chorus 1]
You're making me crazy, oh little baby
Shut your complaining, aye-aye-aye-aye
You make me so angry, someone should pay me
Why don't you get the sty-y-y-yle
Make me smile
[Chorus]
Life's been killing me, but I willingly go
You're kidding me, why keep leading me on?
Keep killing me, won't stop stealing my heart
Keep killing me, won't stop bleeding my soul
You know I go the distance
The path of least resistance[Verse 2]
Oh honey, when you call me, I want to
Stay on the telephone for hours just to get you home
Oh sugar, when you call me after school
I see your smile and I could run a methampheta-mile[Pre-Chorus 2]
I'll never forget it, oh you'll regret it
Nowhere to kiss it, aye-aye-aye-aye
Take it or leave it, better believe it
You'll never see why-y-y-y
Say goodbye[Chorus]
Love's been killing me, but I willingly go
You're kidding me, why keep leading me on?
Keep killing me, won't stop stealing my heart
Keep killing me, won't stop bleeding my soul
You know I go the distance
The path of least resistance[Bridge]
New kind of porno
One that has yet been born, oh
Loving you's like loving a hurricane, I'm tired of
All the mess you make, all the hearts you break
Loving you's like loving a dirty bomb, you're blowing up
All the cash I'm paid, all the love we made[Chorus Variation]
Love's been killing me, but I willingly go
You're kidding me, why keep leading me on?
Keep killing me, won't stop stealing my heart
Keep killing me, won't stop bleeding my soulLove's been killing me, but I willingly go
You're kidding me, why keep leading me on?
Keep killing me, won't stop stealing my heart
Keep killing me, won't stop bleeding my soulYou know I go the distance
The path of least resistance
Your problem with commitments
The bane of my existence[Outro]
True love, it comes once
You messed it up, you stupidI've been out on that open road
You can be my full time daddy, white and gold
Singing blues has been getting old
But you can be my full time baby, hot or coldDon't break me down
I've been traveling too long
I've been trying too hard
With one pretty songI hear the birds on the summer breeze
I drive fast
I am alone at midnight
Been trying hard not to get into trouble
But I, I've got a war in my mind
So, I just ride
Just ride
I just ride, I just rideDying young and playing hard
That's the way my father made his life an art
Drink all day and we talk 'til dark
That's the way the road dogs do it
Light 'til darkDon't leave me now
Don't say goodbye
Don't turn around
Leave me high and dryI hear the birds on the summer breeze
I drive fast
I am alone at midnight
Been trying hard not to get into trouble
But I, I've got a war in my mind
So, I just ride
Just ride
I just ride, I just rideI'm tired of feeling like I'm fucking crazy
I'm tired of driving 'til I see stars in my eyes
It's all I've got to keep myself sane, baby
So I just ride, I just rideHear the birds on the summer breeze
I drive fast
I am alone at midnight
Been trying hard not to get into trouble
But I, I've got a war in my mind
So, I just ride
Just ride
I just ride, I just rideI seen you walk along the riverside
I seen you walk along at ease
And in the air I feel a silence
It whispers perfect on the breeze
And there's a voice that keeps me company
It takes me closer to the stream
And in the break of any suffering
It makes me feel like there's no pain
Finally, finally, finally I'm getting closer
To the dream.
To my dream I believe
I'm up a creek and you're my paddle
Where there is you there is my soul
Another dream where I'm the witness
I am the witness to your goal
Finally, finally, finally I'm getting closer
To the dream.
To my dream I believe.Being a mistress on the side

We've been around on the side

Blue eyes and jazz and attitude
He lives in California too
He drives a Chevy Malibu
And when he calls
He calls for me, and not for you
He lives for love, he loves his drugs
He loves his baby tooBut I can't fix him
Can't make him better
And I can't do nothing about
His strange weatherBut you
Are unfixable
I can't break through your world
'Cause you
Live in shades of cool
Your heart
Is unbreakableMy baby lives in shades of cool
Cool heart and hands and aptitude
He lives for love, for women too
I'm one of many on his blueAnd when he calls
He calls for me, and not for you
He prays for love, he prays for peace
And maybe someone newBut I can't help him
Can't make him better
And I can't do nothing about
His strange weatherCause you
Are unfixable
I can't break through your world
Cause you
Live in shades of cool
Your heart
Is unbreakableYou
Are unfixable
I can't break through your world
'Cause you
Live in shades of cool
Your heart
Is unbreakableLet's go!
When you got her in the back seat
Drivin' round the back streets
Trying to block me out
Do you remember my name?Cruising down Santa Monica Boulevard
Does it light up the spark?
Do you remember my name?Is she a Ride or Die bitch?
Does she know I'm tattooed onto your heart?
You can try to fight it
I have left my mark on you
There is nothing you can doWhen you think you're over me
And your bad baby is dead and gone
Remember I'm the ghost in your machine
I'm your real life suicide blondeYou think that
You're in love, you're in love, you're in love
Well she might be here, might be hot
But baby she's not me, she's not meWhen you take her to Chateau Marmont
'Cause you booked the top suite
Lay her on the bed
Do you remember my name?Strip her down to her bare ass
In her "Kiki Montparnasse"
Like I used to have
Do you remember my name?Is she a Ride or Die bitch?
Does she make you shiver under your skin
Just the way that I did?
It won't be the same again
She don't compare to who I amWhen you think you're over me
And your bad baby is dead and gone
Remember I'm the ghost in your machine
I'm your real life suicide blondeYou think that
You're in love, you're in love, you're in love
Well she might be here, might be hot
But baby she's not meYou try to forget and you tell her that you miss her
But I bet every time you go to kiss her
You get a hot rush feeling on your lips
It's me taking over you, throwing you a curved ballReminding you of our true romancin'
Just like the first time, you learned to dance and
And I showed you all those moves she can't do
She's not me (me, me, me)When you think you're over me
And your bad baby is dead and gone
Remember I'm the ghost in your machine
I'm your real life suicide blondeYou think that
You're in love, you're in love, you're in love
Well she might be here, might be hot

It's like making me crazy
Tell me, "have patience"
Baby, I need this
White lines and black beaches
White lights and black beaches
And blood red sangrias
We traveled for weeks
Just to escape your demons

My summer wine is really made from all these thingsI walked in town on silver spurs that jingled to
A song that I had only sang to just a few
She saw my silver spurs and said lets pass some time
And I will give to you summer wine
Ohh-oh-oh summer wineStrawberries cherries and an angel's kiss in spring
My summer wine is really made from all these things
Take off your silver spurs and help me pass the time
And I will give to you summer wine
Ohhh-oh summer wineMy eyes grew heavy and my lips they could not speak
I tried to get up but I couldn't find my feet
She reassured me with an unfamiliar line
And then she gave to me more summer wine
Mmm-mm summer wineStrawberries cherries and an angel's kiss in spring
My summer wine is really made from all these things
Take off your silver spurs and help me pass the time
And I will give to you summer wine
Mmm-mm summer wineWhen I woke up the sun was shining in my eyes
My silver spurs were gone my head felt twice its size
She took my silver spurs a dollar and a dime
And left me cravin' for more summer wine
Ohh-oh-oh summer wineStrawberries cherries and an angel's kiss in spring
My summer wine is really made from all these things
Take off your silver spurs and help me pass the time
And I will give to you summer wine
Mmm-mm summer wineKiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That, baby, you the bestI got my red dress on tonight
Dancing in the dark in the pale moonlight
Done my hair up real big, beauty queen style

Oh, oh oh, oh ohPut your white tennis shoes on and follow me
Why work so hard when you could just be free?
You got your moment now, you got your legacy
Let's leave the world for the ones who change everything
Nothing could stop the two of us
Let's just get lost, that's what we wantAnd I will never sing again
And you won't work another day
I will never sing again
With just one wave it goes away
It will be our swan song
It will be our swan song
Be our swan song
It will be our swan songDarling, dive deep and dark blue suede
Rushing up from the water where the ice meets
And you've been gone so long, you missed everything
The world can change in a day if you go away
But nothing could stop the two of us
That's what we want
We could just get lostAnd I will never sing again
And you won't work another day
I will never sing again
With just one wave it goes away
It will be our swan song
It will be our swan song
Be our swan song
It will be our swan songLive your life
Live your life, where you've been
Where you're going to (going to)
Say good night
Say good night to the life in the world we live
I'm going to follow youAnd I will never sing again
And you won't work another day
And I will never sing again
You won't work another day
It will be our swan song
It will be our swan song
Be our swan song
Be our swan songPut your white tennis shoes on and follow me
Put your white tennis shoes on and follow me
Put your white tennis shoes on and follow me
Why you work so hard when you could just be freeYou are what you are
I don't matter to anyone
But Hollywood legends will never grow old
And all of what's hidden
Well, it will never grow coldBut I lost myself when I lost you
But I still got jazz when I've got those blues
And I lost myself when I lost you
And I still get trashed, darling, when I hear your tunesBut you are who you are
I won't change you for anything
For when you are crazy
I'll let you be bad
I'll never dare change thee to what you are notBut I lost myself when I lost you
But I still got jazz when I've got those blues
I lost myself and I lost you too
And I still get trashed, baby, when I hear your tunesI put the radio on, hold you tight in my mind
Isn't strange that you're not here with me
But I'm putting all the lights on in the television
Trying to transmit, can you hear me?
Ground control to Major Tom
Can you hear me all night long?

MmmmCarry me home, got my blue nail polish on
It's my favorite color and my favorite tone of song
I don't really wanna break up, we got it going on
It's what you gathered from my talk, but you were wrong
It's not easy for me to talk about
I have heavy heartstrings
I'm not simple, it's trigonometry
It's hard to express
I can't explain
Ever since my baby went away
It's been the blackest day, it's been the blackest dayAll I hear is Billie Holiday
It's all that I play
It's all that I play
Because I'm going deeper and deeper
Harder and harderGetting darker and darker
Looking for love
In all the wrong places
Oh my god
In all the wrong places
Oh my god
Carry me home, got my new car and my gun
Wind in my hair, holding your hand, listen to a songCarry me home, don't wanna talk about the things to come
Just put your hands up in the air, the radio on
Cause there's nothing for us to talk about
Like the future and those things
Cause there's nothing for me to think about
Now that he's gone, I can't feel nothing
Ever since my baby went away
It's been the blackest day, it's been the blackest day
All I hear is Billie HolidayIt's all that I play
It's all that I play
Because I'm going deeper and deeper
Harder and harder
Getting darker and darkerLooking for love
In all the wrong places
Oh my god
In all the wrong places
Oh my god
You should've known better
Than to have, to let her
Get you under her spell of the weatherI got you where I want you
You're deader than ever
And falling for forever
I'm playing head games with you
Got you where I want you
I got you, I got you
I got you where I want you now
Ever since my baby went away
It's been the blackest day, it's been the blackest dayAll I hear is Billie HolidayIt's all that I play
It's all that I play
It's not one of those phases I'm going through
Or just a song, it's not one of them
I'm on my own
On my own
On my own again
I'm on my own again
I'm on my own again
I'm on my own againI miss Long Beach and I miss you, babe
I miss dancin' with you the most of all
I miss the bar where the Beach Boys would goDennis's last stop before KokomoThose nights were on fire
We couldn't get higher
We didn't know that we had it all
But nobody warns you before the fallAnd I'm wasted
Don't leave, I just need a wake-up call
I'm facin' the greatest
The greatest loss of them all
The culture is lit and I had a ball
I guess I'm signin' off after allI miss New York and I miss the music
Me and my friends, we miss rock 'n' roll
I want shit to feel just like it used to
And, baby, I was doin' nothin' the most of allThe culture is lit and if this is it, I had a ball
I guess that I'm burned out after allI'm wasted
Don't leave, I just need a wake-up call
I'm facin' the greatest
The greatest loss of them all
The culture is lit and I had a ball
I guess that I'm burned out after allIf this is it, I'm signin' off
Miss doin' nothin', the most of all
Hawaii just missed a fireball
L.A. is in flames, it's gettin' hot
Kanye West is blond and gone
"Life on Mars" ain't just a song
Oh, the livestream's almost on[Verse 1]
My baby used to dance underneath my architecture
To the Houses of the Holy, smokin' on them cigarettes
My baby used to dance underneath my architecture
He was cool as heck
He was cool as heck[Pre-Chrous]
And we were so obsessed with writing the next best American record
That we give all we had 'til the time we got to bed
'Cause we knew we could
We were so obsessed with writing the next best American record
'Cause we were just that good
It was just that good[Chorus]
Whatever's on tonight' I just wanna party with you
Topanga's hot tonight' I'm taking off my bathing suit
You made me feel like there's something that I never knew
I wanted[Verse 2]
My baby used to dance underneath my architecture
He was '70s in spirit' '90s in his frame of mind
My baby used to dance underneath my architecture
We lost track of space
We lost track of time[Pre-Chorus]
And we were so obsessed with writing the next best American record
That we give all we had 'til the time we got to bed
'Cause we knew we could
We were so obsessed with writing the next best American record
'Cause we were just that good
It was just that good[Chorus - Variation]
Whatever's on tonight, I just wanna party with you
Topanga's hot tonight, I'm taking off my bathing suit
You made me feel like there's something that I never knew
I wanted
We play the Eagles down in Malibu and I want it[Bridge]
It's you' all the roads lead to you
Everything I want and do, all the things that I say
It's true, all the roads lead to you
Like the 405 I drive through
Every night and every day
I see you for who you really are
Why the thousands of girls love
The way Bill plays guitar[Chorus - Variation]
Whatever's on tonight' I just wanna party with you
Topanga's hot tonight, I'm taking off my bathing suit
You made me feel like there's something that I never knew
I wanted
We play the Eagles down in Malibu and I want it
There's something that I never knew I wantedThe other woman has time to manicure her nails
The other woman is perfect where her rival fails
And she's never seen with pin curls in her hair anywhereThe other woman enchants her clothes with French perfume
The other woman keeps fresh cut flowers in each room
There are never toys that's scattered everywhereAnd when her old man comes to call
He finds her waiting like a lonesome queen
'Cause to be by her side
It's such a change from old routineThe other woman will always cry herself to sleep
The other woman will never have his love to keep
And as the years go by, the other woman
Will spend her life alone
Alone
AloneLittle boy,
Livin' without you won't be easy to do
Little boy,
you are the love of my life
And if you don't want to talk to me,
well, then I think that's alrightLord, watch over my love
Lord, watch over my love,
my loveKnowing you are hurt inside,
I think of all your happy times
Oh, myWhen I ask what I can do,
you say,
"Remember me the way I was six months ago"
Oh, I could do so much more for you,
you know,
I can make you well
if you just asked me toOh,
Lord, watch over my love
Lord, watch over my loveI'll do anything for you, or for him,
or whoever else needs some help out there
I swear, I swearLord, watch over my love
Lord, watch over my love
alwaysThink of you on quiet nights,
at traffic lights
and every highway
And I get a little scared sometimes
when everyone I meet
I find has a friendLord, watch over my love
Lord, watch over my love,
my loveRemember how we used to party up all night?
Sneakin' out and looking for a taste of real life
Drinkin' in the small town firelight
(Pabst Blue Ribbon on ice)
Sweet sixteen, and we had arrived
Walking down the streets as they whistle, "Hi, hi!"
Stealin' police cars with the senior guys
Teachers said we'd never make it out aliveThere she was, my new best friend
High heels in her hand, swayin' in the wind
While she starts to cry
Mascara runnin' down her little Bambi eyes
"Lana, how I hate those guys"This is what makes us girls
We all look for heaven and we put our love first
Somethin' that we'd die for, it's our curse
Don't cry about it, don't cry about it
This is what makes us girls
We don't stick together 'cause we put our love first
Don't cry about him, don't cry about him
It's all gonna happenAnd that's where the beginning of the end begun
Everybody knew that we had too much fun
We were skippin' school and drinkin' on the job
With the boss
Sweet sixteen, and we had arrived
Baby's table dancin' at the local dive
Cheering our names in the pink spotlight
Drinkin' cherry schnapps in the velvet nightYo, we used to go break into the hotel
Glimmering, we'd swim
Running from the cops in our black bikini tops
Screaming, "Get us while we're hot, get us while we're hot"
(C'mon, take a shot)This is what makes us girls
We all look for heaven and we put our love first
Somethin' that we'd die for, it's our curse
Don't cry about it, don't cry about it
This is what makes us girls
We don't stick together 'cause we put our love first
Don't cry about him, don't cry about him
It's all gonna happenThe prettiest in-crowd that you had ever seen
Ribbons in our hair, and our eyes gleamed mean
A freshmen generation of degenerate beauty queens
And you know somethin'?
They were the only friends I ever had
We got into trouble and when stuff got bad
I got sent away, I was waving on the train platform
Cryin' 'cause I know I'm never coming backThis is what makes us girls
We all look for heaven and we put our love first
Somethin' that we'd die for, it's our curse
Don't cry about it, don't cry about it
This is what makes us girls
We don't stick together 'cause we put our love first
Don't cry about him, don't cry about him
It's all gonna happen"Hey, what you doin'?" Not a lot
Shakin' and movin' at my local spot
Baby, don't ask me why
Don't ask me why
Why, why, why, why, why, why, whyLay, Lady, lay on that side of a paradise
In the Tropic of Cancer
'Cause if I had my way, you would always stay
And I'd be your tiny dancer, honeyI waited for you
In the spot you said to wait
In the city, on the park bench
In the middle of the pourin' rain
'Cause I adored you
I just wanted things to be the same
You said to meet me up there tomorrow
But tomorrow never came
Tomorrow never cameHey, what you thinkin'? Penny for your thoughts
Those lights are blinkin' on that old jukebox
But don't ask me why
Just swallow some wine
Wi-wi-wi-wi-wi-wi-wineStay, baby, stay on the side of a paradise
In the Tropic of Cancer
'Cause if I had my way, you would always stay
And you'd be my tiny dancer, babyI waited for you
In the spot you said to wait
In the city, on the park bench
In the middle of the pourin' rain
'Cause I adored you
And I just wanted things to be the same
You said you'd meet me up there tomorrow
But tomorrow never came
Tomorrow never cameRoses out in your country house
We played guitar in your barn
And everyday felt like Sunday
And I, I wish we had stayed home
And I could put on the radio to our favorite song
Lennon and Yoko, we would play all day long
"Isn't life crazy?", I said now that I'm singin' with Sean
WhoaI could keep waitin' for you
In the spot we always wait
In the city, on the park bench
In the summer, on the pourin' rain
Honey, don't ignore me
I just wanted it to be the same
You said you'd love me like no tomorrow
I guess tomorrow never came (no, no, no)
Tomorrow never came (no, no)
Tomorrow never came (no, no, no)
Tomorrow never cameAnd the spirit of John moved upon the face of the waters.And John said: "Let there be light." And there was light.And John saw that it was good.Dear John forgive us our sins.Creator of all, forgive us our sins.Thank you.I wanna tell you where you at.

Jesus is my bestest friend.
We don't need nobody 'cause we got each other
Or at least I pretend
We get down every Friday night
Dancin' and grindin' in the pale moonlight
Grand Ole Opry, we're feelin' alright
Mary prays the rosary for my broken mind
(So don't worry about)
I sing the body electric
I sing the body electric, baby
I sing the body electric
I sing the body electric
Sing the body electric
Sing the body electric
I'm on fire, sing that body electric
Whitman is my daddy, Monaco's my mother
Diamonds are my bestest friend
Heaven is my baby, suicide's her father
Opulence is the end
We get down every Friday night
Dancin' and grindin' in the pale moonlight
Grand Ole Opry, we're feelin' alright
Mary prays the rosary for my broken mind
(So don't worry about)
I sing the body electric
I sing the body electric, baby
I sing the body electric
I sing the body electric
Sing the body electric
Sing the body electric
I'm on fire, sing that body electric
My clothes still smell like you
And all the photographs say, that we're still young.
I pretend I'm not hurt
I go about the world like I'm havin' fun.
We get crazy every Friday night
I drop it like it's hot in the pale moonlight.
Grand Ole Opry, feelin' all right
Mary's swayin' softly, to her heart's delight
I sing the body electric
I sing the body electric, baby
I sing the body electric
I sing the body electric
Sing the body electric
Sing the body electric
I'm on fire, sing that body electric
I sing the body electric, baby
I sing the body electric, baby
I sing the body electric, babyI sing the Body electric;
The armies of those I love engirt me, and I engirt them;
They will not let me off till I go with them, respond to them, (Man you've got to be crazy!)
And discorrupt them, and charge them full with the charge of the SoulWomanhood, and all that is woman - and the man that comes from woman
The womb, the tits, nipples, breast-milk, tears, laughter, weeping, love-looks, love-perturbations and rising
The voice, articulation
Language
Whispering, shouting aloud
Food, drink, pulse, digestion, sweat, sleep
Walking, swimming, poise on the hips
Leaping, reclining, embracing, arm-curving and tightening
The continual changes of the flex of the mouth
And around the eyes
The skin, the sun-burnt shade, freckles, hair
The curious sympathy one feels, when feeling with the hand the naked meat of the body
The circling rivers, the breath, and breathing it in and out
The beauty of the waist, and thence of the hips, and thence downward toward the knees
The thin red jellies within you or within me - the bones and the marrow in the bones
The exquisite realization of health;
O I say, these are not the parts and poems of the Body only, but of the Soul
O I say now these are the Soul!
Gods & MonstersIn the land of Gods and Monsters
I was an Angel
Living in the garden of evil
Screwed up, scared, doing anything that I needed
Shining like a fiery beacon
You got that medicine I need
Fame, Liquor, Love give it to me slowly
Put your hands on my waist, do it softly
Me and God, we don't get along so now I sing
No one's gonna take my soul away
I'm living like Jim Morrison
Headed towards a fucked up holiday
Motel sprees sprees and I'm singing
'Fuck yeah give it to me this is heaven, what I truly
Want'
It's innocence lost
Innocence lost
In the land of Gods and Monsters
I was an Angel
Looking to get fucked hard
Like a groupie incognito posing as a real singer
Life imitates art
You got that medicine I need
Dope, shoot it up, straight to the heart please
I don't really wanna know what's good for me
God's dead, I said 'baby that's alright with me'
No one's gonna take my soul away
I'm living like Jim Morrison
Headed towards a fucked up holiday
Motel sprees sprees and I'm singing
'Fuck yeah give it to me this is heaven, what I truly
Want'
It's innocence lost
Innocence lost
When you talk it's like a movie and you're making me
Crazy
Cause life imitates art
If I get a little prettier can I be your baby?
You tell me, "life isn't that hard"
No one's gonna take my soul away
I'm living like Jim Morrison
Headed towards a fucked up holiday
Motel sprees sprees and I'm singing
'Fuck yeah give it to me this is heaven, what I truly
Want'
It's innocence lost
Innocence lost(- For I must have you or no one!)- "You know it's not always gonna be this way, right?"
- "Yeah."
- "So just chill, alright?"
- "Mhmm"
- "Alright."
- "Yeah."(Just remember, I'm always there for you.)(In honour of Jack's birthday tonight;I thought I bring somebody here tonight that Jack can jack off to.Are you ready?Ladies.-Lord Almighty, I feel my temperature rising)I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked
Dragging themselves through the negro streets at dawn looking for an angry fix
Angel-headed hipsters burning for the ancient heavenly connection to the starry dynamo in the machinery of night
Who poverty and tatters and hollow-eyed and high sat up smoking in the supernatural darkness of cold-water flats floating across the tops of cities contemplating jazz
Who bared their brains to Heaven under the El and saw Mohammedan angels staggering on tenement roofs illuminated
Who passed through universities with radiant cool eyes hallucinating Arkansas and Blake-light tragedy among the scholars of war
Who were expelled from the academies for crazy & publishing obscene odes on the windows of the skull
Who cowered in unshaven rooms in underwear, burning their money in wastebaskets and listening to the Terror through the wall
Who got busted in their pubic beards returning through Laredo with a belt of marijuana for New York
Who ate fire in paint hotels or drank turpentine in Paradise Alley, death, or purgatoried their torsos night after night
With dreams, with drugs, with waking nightmaresAnd so, from being created in his likeness, to being banished for wanting to be too much like him, we were cast out, and the garden of Eden transformed in to the garden of Evil
Los Angeles, The city of Angels, A land of Gods and Monsters, The in-between realm where only the choices made from your free will, will decide your souls final fate
Some poets called it the entrance to the Underworld, but on some summer nights, it could feel like Paradise, Paradise Lost...Dear John, forgive us our sins. x2Master of the universe, creator of all, forgive us our sins.Dear John, forgive us our sins.(You ask me why I love her? Well give me time, I'll explain
Have you ever seen a Kansas sunset or an Arizona rain?
Have you ever drifted on a bayou down Louisiana way?
Or watched a cold fog come drifting in over San Francisco Bay?
Have you heard a bobwhite calling in the Carolina pines
Or heard the bellow of a diesel at the Appalachia mines?
Does the call of Niagara thrill you when you hear her waters roar?
Or do you look with awe and wonder, Massachusetts shore
Brave new men who stepped on Plymounth's rock?
And do you think of them when you stroll along a New York City dock?
Have you seen a snowflake drifting in the Rockies, way up high?
Or seen the sun come blazing down from a bright Nevada sky?
Do you hail to the Columbia as she rushes to the sea
Or bow your head at Gettysburg at our struggle to be free?
You ask me why I love her? I've got a million reasons why:
It's my beautiful America, beneath God's wide, wide skyBel AirGargoyles standing at the front of your gate.
Trying to tell me to wait
But I can't wait to see you.
So I run like I'm mad to heaven's door.
I don't wanna be bad
I won't cheat you no more.
Roses, Bel Air, take me there
I've been waiting to meet you.
Palm trees in the light
I can sleep late at night
Darling, I'm waiting to greet you
Come to me, baby.
Spotlight, bad baby, you've got a flair
For the violentest kind of love anywhere out there
Mon amour, sweet child of mine
You're divine.
Didn't anyone ever tell you
It's OK to shine?
Roses, Bel Air, take me there
I've been waiting to meet you.
Palm trees in the light
I can sleep late at night.
Darling, I'm waiting to greet you
Come to me, baby.
Don't be afraid of me, don't be ashamed.
Walk in the way of my soft resurrection.
Idol of roses, iconic soul. I know your name.
Lead me to war with your brilliant direction.
Roses, Bel Air, take me there
I've been waiting to meet you.
Palm trees in the light
I can sleep late at night.
Darling, I'm waiting to greet you
Come to me, baby
Roses, Bel Air, take me there
I've been waiting to meet you
Grenadine sunshine, can you fade inside of mine
Darling, I'm waiting to greet you
Come to me, baby
(Your always on my mind, Your always on my mind)If you get lonely think of me only
Prison isn't going to keep me from you
Remember Coney Island and how we'd
Wade into the water 'til the waves turned blueNobody does have to know
That our love's alive
Keep it on the low
If you want to hide
Got that same address
If you want to write
One Greenwich Avenue
Wishin' and thinkin' of youLiving without you is like TV in black and white
You turn me on and brought colour into my life
When I'm around you suddenly I realize
That I was blind before I saw the world through your eyesIf you get lonely think of this only
Heaven hasn't forgotten about you oh
Though you can't hold me
Pick up and phone me
Use your one phone call on your ex girl booI won't tell a single soul
How you spend your nights
In your single cell
Holding your pillow tight
If you really are afraid
Then you ought to know
That you're the one I want the one I want
Forever moreLiving without you is like TV in black and white
You turn me on and brought colour into my life
When I'm around you suddenly I realize
That I was blind before I saw the world through your eyesI know you get scared sometimes boy
Nothing to be feared when you're in my heart
Troubles come in threes but in your case
They came in millions and trillions but that's alrightLiving without you is like TV in black and white
You turn me on and brought colour into my life
When I'm around you suddenly I realize
That I was blind before I saw the world through your eyesLike TV in black and white
Like TV in black and white
Like TV in black and whiteLike TV in black and whiteHe used to call me DN
That stood for Deadly Nightshade
Cause I was filled with poison
But blessed with beauty and rage
Jim told me that
He hit me and it felt like a kiss
Jim brought me back
Reminded me of when we were kidsWith his Ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
I can hear sirens, sirens
He hit me and it felt like a kiss
I can hear violins, violins
Give me all of that UltraviolenceHe used to call me poison
Like I was poison ivy
I could have died right there
Cause he was right beside me
Jim raised me up
He hurt me but it felt like true love
Jim taught me that
Loving him was never enoughWith his Ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
I can hear sirens, sirens
He hit me and it felt like a kiss
I can hear violins, violins
Give me all of that UltraviolenceWe could go back to New York
Loving you was really hard
We could go back to Woodstock
Where they don't know who we are
Heaven is on Earth
I would do anything for you, babe
Blessed is this union
Crying tears of gold like lemonadeI love you the first time, I love you the last time
Yo soy la princesa, comprende mis white lines
Cause I'm your jazz singer and you're my cult leader

Be free and alive
Baby
Give heaven a try, be young and be wild
Just feel alive,
It's just you and the sun,

This isn't where we intended to be
We had it all, you believed in me
I believed in youCertainties disappear
What do we do for our dreams to survive?
How do we keep all our passions alive
As we used to do?Deep in my heart, I'm concealing
Things that I'm longing to say
Scared to confess what I'm feeling
Frightened you'll slip away
You must love me, you must love meWhy are you at my side?
How can I be any use to you now?
Give me a chance, and I'll let you see how
Nothing has changedDeep in my heart, I'm concealing
Things that I'm longing to say
Scared to confess what I'm feeling
Frightened you'll slip away
You must love me
You must love me
You must love meWhere do we go from here?
This isn't where we intended to be

Frightened you'll slip awayYou must love me
You must love meYou must love meJerry says that anytime
I think I have a good idea,
That I should do the opposite
Of whatever it is I feel.
And that's because I have a bad mind,
And I have gold in my veins.
But he says I got the purest heart
That he's ever seen, oh.What God give me a brain for?
He won't help me use it.
What God give me a plan for,
If he won't help me do it?You're gonna love me,
I'm gonna make you.
You're gonna love me,
I'm gonna make you.Well I can tell that you're the type
To never trust a beauty queen.
But I was never voted for nothing,
And high school never meaned
Anything to anybody,
Never ever gave myself away.
But even when I'm funny,
You think I'm acting, so I say:What God give me a brain for,
If he won't let me use it?
What'd God give me a plan for?
He never helps me do it.You're gonna love me,
I'm gonna have to make you.
You're gonna love me,
I'm gonna make you.You say that you don't want to be hypnotized,
But baby I, I don't want to hypnotize you.
There's nothing from you that I want to take.
I just want to be like you.
(Maybe love you just a little bit),
Please. Oh, oh, ohJim, I dedicate this whole album to you.
You told me to get my way,
That's exactly what I'm gonna do.I'm going to strike out, right now.
I'm striking out right now with this song.
But I can't help myself;
I can't do right for long,
You know that.What God give me a brain for?
He knows that I can't use it.
I don't know why he'd give me a plan for,
He never lets me do it.But you're gonna love me,
I'm gonna make you.
You gonna love me,
I'm gonna make you.I'm doin' alright, most of the time
in fact, yesterday, i was even doin' real well
and i, think that i might claim you as mine
so that my half can rest and everybody can tell
and i, had a strange dream
and i, called you at night
and i, had to make known that i wasn't alright
and say that i had you on my mind
had you, on my mindi make it a point to rest through my day
to close my eyes and visualize my troubles away
and i, think of you here
and i, close my eyes tight
so now the vision of you near makes me feel alright
and i, had a strange dream
and i, called you at night
and i, had to make known that i wasn't alright
and say that i had you on my mindhad you, on my mind
had you, on my minddo-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm hmm mmm
do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
mmm hmm mmm mmmmmmhad you, on my mind
had you, on my mindI've seen the world
Done it all, had my cake now
Diamonds, brilliant, and Bel Air now
Hot summer nights, mid July
When you and I were forever wild
The crazy days, the city lights
The way you'd play with me like a childWill you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me when I got nothing but my aching soul?
I know you will, I know you will
I know that you will
Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?I've seen the world, lit it up as my stage now
Channeling angels in, the New Age now
Hot summer days, rock and roll
The way you'd play for me at your show
And all the ways I got to know
Your pretty face and electric soulWill you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me when I got nothing but my aching soul?
I know you will, I know you will
I know that you will
Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?Dear lord, when I get to heaven
Please let me bring my man
When he comes tell me that you'll let him in
Father tell me if you can
Oh that grace, oh that body
Oh that face makes me wanna party
He's my sun, he makes me shine like diamondsAnd will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me when I got nothing but my aching soul?
I know you will, I know you will
I know that you willWill you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?
Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?
Will you still love me when I'm not young and beautiful?Carry me off stage
I can't do this anymore
Been gone for 3 years, is that enough for you boy?[Pre-Chorus 1]
Carry me to my bed, paint my toe nails blue
Tell me all about the things that you and I will never do[Chorus]
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
Ah
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
Ah[Verse 2]
Carry me off stage
I've had too much to drink
Been on the road too long
And I've had too much time to think[Pre-Chorus 2]
Carry me to my bed, lay me in a pillow town
Kiss me on my head
Remind me of the way we will not know[Chorus]
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
Ah
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
Ah[Bridge]
Late at night, baby you're my sign
Call me late if you wanna get high
Late at night, laying in Versailles
You and I get to know one anotherLate at night, baby you're my sign
Call me late if you wanna get high
Late at night, baby you and I
Can get to know one another[*Cause late at night, we have one life to kill
Oh You and I
Can get to know the thrill
Cause baby you're my sign
And I wanna get to know ya*][Chorus]
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
Ah
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
Ah[Outro]
(Ah)
(Ah)
(Ah)
